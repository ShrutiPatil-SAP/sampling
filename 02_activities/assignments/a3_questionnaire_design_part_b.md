# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```
Answer: The quality of the sample in this survey design will be strong, given the use of stratified random sampling with strata for both current employees and those who have recently departed. This approach increases the chances of capturing a range of experiences and perspectives, providing a fuller picture of the factors behind employee turnover.The sample is expected to be representative of the target population, as it includes individuals from both still employed individuals and those who have left within the past year. Including recent departures is particularly important, as these individuals may provide insights into reasons for turnover that current employees may not disclose. However, itâ€™s possible that former employees who felt especially dissatisfied or disconnected might be less likely to participate, which could introduce some response bias. Efforts to reach out to all eligible individuals and assure confidentiality can help mitigate this potential bias, enhancing sample quality and representativeness.

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```
An observational study could identify patterns related to turnover but would lack the subjective and prescriptive insights necessary to fully understand and address the reasons behind employee turnover.
while observational data could reveal certain patterns or trends related to turnover, it lacks the depth and specificity needed to address the root causes. A survey allows employees to share their experiences, perceptions, and suggestions directly, providing a comprehensive understanding of the factors driving turnover and insights on how to create a more supportive and satisfying work environment. This direct feedback is essential for making informed decisions on interventions that can enhance employee satisfaction and retention.
