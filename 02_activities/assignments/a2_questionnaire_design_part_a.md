# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part A)

## Requirements
Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.


### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

The purpose of this survey is to understand the factors contributing to employee turnover at a large tech company. The survey aims to identify specific areas where employees may be dissatisfied and gather insights into what changes could improve employee retention, particularly in entry- and lower-level positions.

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
Target Population: Current and former employees in entry- and lower-level positions at the tech company.

Sampling Frame: All employees in entry- and lower-level roles who have worked at the company within the past year, including those who have recently left.

Sampling Units: Individual employees, both current and former, at the entry and lower levels.

Sampling Strategy: Stratified random sampling, dividing respondents into two strata: current employees and recently departed employees. This approach will allow us to compare responses from those who are still employed with those who have left, helping us better understand turnover factors and potential solutions.

```
Your 5-10 question survey:
```
1. How long have you worked at the company?
2. What were your primary reasons for joining the company?(giving multiple choice options here)
3. If you have considered leaving (or have already left), what were the main reasons?(giving multiple choice options here)
4. What aspects of your job do you find most fulfilling?
5. On a scale of 1 to 5, how satisfied are/were you with your current/past role?
6. How would you rate the quality of management and leadership in your department?
7. Do you feel that your work is valued and appreciated by the company?
8. What changes would make you more likely to stay at the company?
